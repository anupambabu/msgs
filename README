-- this is fairly old school work yo --

i'm not gonna go too far into this, but basically, way back when i jumped
from blackberry, with its beautiful bbm and essay-writer-worthy keyboard,
to an iphone, with its, touchscreen, i couldn't help but feel like i had
lost a limb feeling constantly disconnected from all the people i used to
talk to on bbm and a persistent gtalk connection.

and since i've always been up on the utopia that technology can help enable
by means of providing amazing ways to communicate with each other, seamlessly,
i got all up on this idea of "omnipresence" and decided i was gonna stitch
back my missing limb, by building a cross platform messaging platform that
didn't suck, to me, in the way i felt all the other ones did (especially on
the iphone, with its background-app-forcing, connection-dropping goodness,
which i was gonna try to get around using the whole voip thing, which long 
term was part of my plan towards this whole omnipresence thing).

but turns out, i didn't like reading, plus i hated the blackberry "sdk",
especially because i don't like windows, so even though the clients for
the iphone and the berry got "complete" enough to barely function as messaging
apps, they well, barely functioned, and turns out that trying to finish that
kinda stuff while you're working at a game studio in "ship" mode
(read: long days, where at the end of them, there's not even a hallway between 
getting through the door back home each day and face first into bed, which,
as a sentence, probably just made absolutely no grammatical sense whatsoever).

plus, other apps got better enough so i just relaxed and didn't worry about
having to actually make the paranoia-ly lossless history synchronization protocol
efficient in any way whatsoever -- score!

anyways, standard disclaimer:

there's a bunch of extra junk in here you probably don't need to run it,
while on the other hand, its probably missing some stuff you do
(as well as any explanation of how all this junk works,
license information that i probably stripped from a bunch of files
and any sort of sanity). so funny.
